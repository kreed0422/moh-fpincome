    I certify that the information given in this application form and any

  <p>
    I believe that my family's income for this year or last year is at least 10%
    lower than the income used to calculate the Fair PharmaCare coverage I now
    have.

    I understand that the information given in this application form and any
    documentation attached to it:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Will be used to determine, verify and administer my and/or my family's
        Fair PharmaCare Plan coverage;
      </li>
      <li>
        Will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the
        <em>Pharmaceutical Services Act</em> and the
        <em>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</em>.

  <p>
    I acknowledge that if information from the Canada Revenue Agency
    demonstrates that my family's income is not at least 10% lower than the
    income used to calculate the Fair PharmaCare coverage I now have, I will be
    required to repay the Ministry of Health any assistance I received in excess
    of the assistance for which I was actually eligible.
